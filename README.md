# ADC Android Device Controller

An Android Studio plugin to control your development devices and emulators. Currently you can do the following from within your IDE:

- Toggle the "Show Layout Bounds"
- Change the locale of the device
- Open the currently active activity in your IDE (if the project contains that class)
- Send text to the device (simulate keyboard input)
- Clear Data (for all apps contained in current project)

More features to come.

It has been used on devices running Lollipop and better. On older devices not all features might work as expected.

# Installation

The plugin is available from the plugins repository at https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8377?pr=androidstudio

Just open _Settings_ and choose _Plugins_, _Browse repositories_ and search for _Android Device Controller_
